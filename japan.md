<h4>Day 1</h4>

The timeline of today’s entry will be very convoluted. We are going to completely redefine what a “day” is, and it will only make sense if you don’t think about it too much. Don’t blame me, blame the human time system, an arbitrary concept which could have been designed much better, but it’s now the universal standard and it’s too late to change it. 

Today took place over the course of three days. In fact, today probably started at the end of the first day. You see, today was a travel day. I had to pack (yes, I packed last minute for a 4 month trip, in the course of 1-2 hours), and spend my final day with Sangeetha, who was home for spring break. After an average Thai dinner and an underwhelming attempt to binge Pantheon (animated TV show), I was dropped off at SFO and boarded my flight just after midnight (the second day of today has occurred).

Airplane food on Asian Airlines is vastly superior to its counterpart on European or American Airlines. One can only hope the latter discovers flavor. I landed in Taipei at 5:30am, the following day, since I crossed the international date line (the third day has occurred). I decided to use my layover time to check out the airport. It was a waste of time, there is nothing special about the Taipei airport, it’s just your average airport. Good food though, I had some braised beef noodles. I spent the remaining time catching up on the news, and in wonderful fashion, Le Pen was found guilty of embezzlement and barred from running in 2027. One can only hope France does not go down the racism route.

I boarded my flight to Japan, and landed a bit behind schedule. Now, I don’t know how Tokyo is, but the Osaka airport is miserably…. involved, let’s say. As I had not filled out the Japan Tourism arrival online form, I did not have a QR code, which seemed to be needed everywhere. They would not let you do anything without one. In fact, when asked if I have my QR code, I responded no, and they didn’t let me through to immigration. The internet at the airport was spotty, so I was taking quite awhile to fill out the online form, but before I could finish, a different worker pointed me to the paper arrival card area. That could have saved me 30 minutes. I finally made it through, found my luggage, went to fill out another paper customs declaration card (I knew to look for it this time), and was ready to go. 

I now needed an ICOCA card for local travel, and tickets for the express train to Kyoto. Both could only be purchased with cash. I had to go find an ATM, find where I could purchase them, and managed to barely make the train in time. I had a wonderful train ride to Kyoto, where I took a Timelapse along the way, and checked into my hostel. 

The end of my day consisted of speaking with a Danish girl about things to do in Kyoto. It seems she kept getting caught in tourist traps, and was warning me not do so half the things she had done. After, I decided to go for walk, with no particular direction in mind. I came across this beautiful park, with shrines, cherry blossoms galore, and tourists. There are tons of food stalls and vendors, and the place is riddled with tourists. Despite this, the park was quite nice and I got some wonderful pictures and tasty food.

I have now returned to my hostel, and will have a much needed rest to tackle day 2.
