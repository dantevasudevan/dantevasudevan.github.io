<b> From April till August of 2025, I traversed 3 separate continents, engaging in solo travelling, volunteering abroad, and visiting family. Below you can read about my daily escapades, traveling and experiencing vicariously through the words on this page. If any parts appear non-sequitur, as if there is context or story missing, consider it an exercise left to the reader, as I do not make mistakes.  </b>
